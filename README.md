This project focuses on applying popular machine learning techniques to predict bike rental demand based on a dataset collected during 2017-18 in Seoul. The assignment aims to develop practical skills in data handling, visualization, experimental design, and result interpretation, aligning with key areas of the ACS CBOK (Australian Computer Society's Core Body of Knowledge)
By completing this project, participants will gain practical experience in applying machine learning techniques to a specific domain (bike rentals in Seoul), reinforcing foundational skills in data science and computational analysis. The project not only enhances technical proficiency but also emphasizes the importance of clear communication and interpretation of results, crucial for effective problem-solving in data-driven fields.
