# Predicting Bike Rentals using Machine Learning

This project explores the application of machine learning techniques to predict daily bike rental counts based on various environmental and seasonal factors. The goal is to build a model that accurately forecasts bike demand, aiding businesses in optimizing bike-sharing operations.

## Overview

Bike-sharing systems have become an integral part of urban transportation. Predicting bike rentals helps operators manage resources efficiently and meet user demands. This project leverages a publicly available dataset and machine learning models to analyze and predict bike rental patterns.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes handling missing values, feature engineering, and scaling data for improved model performance.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizes trends and relationships between bike rentals and key features like temperature, weather conditions, and season.
- **Model Building and Evaluation**: Implements machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest) and evaluates them using metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and RÂ² score.

## Results

The project demonstrates that machine learning models can effectively predict bike rentals based on environmental and temporal features. Key insights derived from the data analysis and predictions can help optimize bike-sharing operations.
